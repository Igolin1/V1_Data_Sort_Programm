# V1_Data_Sort_Programm
Weâ€™re excited to introduce Version 1.1, which significantly expands the range of supported file types compared to the previous version.

While the functionality and user experience remain consistent with Version 1.0, this update brings extensive compatibility enhancements, enabling seamless handling of an exceptionally larger number of file formats.

This improvement ensures better flexibility and usability for a wider range of workflows, making the program more versatile than ever.

Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to your feedback!
